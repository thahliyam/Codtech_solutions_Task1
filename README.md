# Codtech_solutions_Task1
Hello! My name is Thahliya, and I have an academic background in Mathematics (MSc). I am currently enhancing my skills in data science and machine learning, with expertise in tools such as Python, Power BI, Excel, and MySQL. My passion lies in leveraging data to uncover insights and solve real-world problems. Through projects like this one, I aim to apply my knowledge to practical challenges and build a strong foundation for a career in data analytics and science.

About the Task
Task Overview
This project focuses on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a dataset using Python libraries like pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn. The purpose of EDA is to understand the data's structure, identify patterns, detect outliers, and uncover relationships between variables. By visualizing these findings, we can derive actionable insights and prepare the data for further analysis or modeling.

Steps Followed
Data Loading and Inspection:

Loaded the dataset and reviewed its structure, including dimensions, column names, and data types.
Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.
Summary Statistics:

Calculated basic descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation) to understand the distribution of each variable.
Data Cleaning:

Identified and handled missing, duplicate, or inconsistent entries.
Standardized the dataset to ensure uniformity across values.
Univariate Analysis:

Examined individual variables using histograms, boxplots, and descriptive statistics.
Detected and visualized outliers.
Bivariate Analysis:

Explored relationships between pairs of variables using scatter plots, bar plots, and correlation matrices.
Identified strong correlations and possible linear relationships.
Multivariate Analysis:

Analyzed multiple variables together using heatmaps and pairplots to uncover deeper insights.
Examined potential interactions between variables.
Key Insights:

Summarized findings, highlighting patterns, trends, and anomalies that could influence further analysis or business decisions.
